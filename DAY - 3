**451. Sort Characters By Frequency**

# Approach 1 :
# Using Python in-built function most_common()
# most_common() : Returns a list consists of tuples and each tuple contains the element and the element count.

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        res = ""
        count = Counter(s).most_common()
        
        for c,v in count: 
            res += c*v 
        return res


# Approach 2 :
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        c = Counter(list(s))
        c_list = sorted(c,key = lambda x:c[x],reverse = True)

        res = []
        for char in c_list:
            res.append(char * c[char])
        return "".join(res)
