** 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        return max(s.rfind(ch) - s.find(ch) - 1 for ch in set(s))

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def maxLengthBetweenEqualCharacters(self, s: str) -> int:
        ans = -1
        seen = {}
        for i, c in enumerate(s): 
            if c in seen: ans = max(ans, i - seen[c] - 1)
            seen.setdefault(c, i)
        return ans
