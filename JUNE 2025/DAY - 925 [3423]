** 3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def maxAdjacentDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        return max(abs(nums[0]-nums[-1]), max(abs(x-y) for x, y in pairwise(nums)))

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def maxAdjacentDistance(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        diff = 0
        counter = 1

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if counter == len(nums):
                counter = 0
            
            temp = abs(nums[i] - nums[counter])
            if temp > diff:
                diff = temp
            
            counter += 1

        return diff
