** 2037. Minimum Number of Moves to Seat Everyone **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()
        moves = 0

        for i in range(len(seats)) :
            moves += abs(seats[i] - students[i])

        return moves

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def minMovesToSeat(self, seats: List[int], students: List[int]) -> int:
        seats.sort()
        students.sort()
        return sum(abs(seat - student) for seat, student in zip(seats, students))
