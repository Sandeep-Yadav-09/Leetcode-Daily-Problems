** 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(questions)
        game_winner = [0] * n

        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            curr_points, curr_brainpower = questions[i][0], questions[i][1]
            next_house = i + curr_brainpower + 1
            curr_points = curr_points + game_winner[next_house] if next_house < n else curr_points
            
            if i < n-1:
                curr_points = max(curr_points, game_winner[i+1])
            
            game_winner[i] = curr_points
        
        return game_winner[0]
        
# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        n = len(questions)
        dp = [0] * (n+1)
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            point = questions[i][0]
            jump = questions[i][1]
            nextQuestion = min(n, i+jump+1)
            dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], point + dp[nextQuestion])
        return dp[0]
        
# Approach 3:
class Solution:
    def mostPoints(self, questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        dp = {}
        def dfs(i):
            if i >= len(questions):
                return 0

            if i in dp:
