** 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        for ch in s:
		    # Find and replace only one occurence of this character in t
            t = t.replace(ch, '', 1)
            
        return len(t)

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, S: str, T: str) -> int:
        D = collections.Counter(S) - collections.Counter(T)
        return sum(max(0, D[s]) for s in set(S))
