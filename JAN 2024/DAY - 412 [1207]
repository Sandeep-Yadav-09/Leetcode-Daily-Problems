** 1207. Unique Number of Occurrences **

# Approach 1:
from collections import Counter

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        
        cnt = Counter(arr)     
        x = cnt.values()
        y = set(x)
        return len(x) == len(y)

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:

       # Get the occurrences of each number. (also remove duplicated numbers)
        Number_Occurrences = Counter(arr)

        # Remove duplicated occurences using a set
        Unique_Occurrences = set(Number_Occurrences.values())
        
        # return Truen if each unique number has a unique occurrence
        return len(Number_Occurrences.keys()) == len(Unique_Occurrences)
