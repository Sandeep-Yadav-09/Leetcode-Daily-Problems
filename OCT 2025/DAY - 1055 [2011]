** 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        return sum(1 if op[1]=='+' else -1 for op in operations)

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def finalValueAfterOperations(self, operations: List[str]) -> int:
        count = 0
        for op in operations:
            if "-" in op:
                count -= 1
            else:
                count += 1
        return count
