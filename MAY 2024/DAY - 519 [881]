** 881. Boats to Save People **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: List[int], limit: int) -> int:
        people.sort()
        
        boatCount, left, right = 0, 0, len(people) - 1
        while left <= right:
            if people[left] + people[right] <= limit:
                left += 1
                right -= 1
            else:
                right -= 1
            boatCount += 1
        return boatCount

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def numRescueBoats(self, people: list[int], limit: int) -> int:
        ps = sorted(people)
        boats = 0
        i, j = 0, len(ps) - 1
        while i <= j:
            i = i + 1 if ps[i] + ps[j] <= limit else i
            j -= 1
            boats += 1
        return boats
