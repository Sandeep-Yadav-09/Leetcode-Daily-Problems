** 3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        ones = 0
        res = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            if c == '1':
                ones += 1
            elif i > 0 and s[i - 1] == '1':
                res += ones
        return res

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def maxOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        out = 0
        oneCount = 0
        firstZero = True
        
        for char in s:
            if char == "1":
                oneCount += 1
                firstZero = True

            elif firstZero == True:
                firstZero = False
                out += oneCount
        
        return out
