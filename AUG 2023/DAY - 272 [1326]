** 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
        dp[0] = 0

            start, end = max(0, i - r), min(n, i + r)
            for j in range(start + 1, end + 1):
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[start] + 1)
                
        return dp[-1] if dp[-1] != float('inf') else -1

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def minTaps(self, n: int, ranges: List[int]) -> int:
        min_pos = 0
        max_pos = 0
        count = 0  # Initialize variables to keep track of the minimum and maximum reach, and the number of taps used.

            for i in range(len(ranges)):

                if i - ranges[i] <= min_pos and i + ranges[i] >= max_pos:
                    max_pos = i + ranges[i]  # Update the maximum reach if this tap can cover the current range.
                    
            if max_pos == min_pos:
                return -1  # If max_pos is not updated in this loop, it means we can't extend the reach further. Return -1 as it's not possible.
            
            count += 1  # Increment the count of taps used.
            min_pos = max_pos  # Update the minimum reach to the newly reached maximum position.

# Approach 3:
