** 3163. String Compression III **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def compressedString(self, word: str) -> str:
        count, ans, prev = 0, "", word[0]
        for ch in word:
            if ch != prev or count == 9:
                ans += str(count) + prev
                prev = ch
                count = 0
            count += 1

        if count:
            ans += str(count) + prev

        return ans

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def compressedString(self, word: str) -> str:
        comp = ""
        i = 0
        n = len(word)
        
        while i < n:
            char = word[i]
            count = 0
            while i < n and word[i] == char and count < 9:
                count += 1
                i += 1
            comp += str(count) + char
        
        return comp
