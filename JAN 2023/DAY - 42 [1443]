** 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for u, v in edges:

            visited.add(node)
            secs = 0
            for child in adj[node]:
                secs += dfs(child)
            if secs > 0:

            return 2 if hasApple[node] else 0

        return max(dfs(0) - 2, 0)
        

# Approach 2:
import collections

    def minTime(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], hasApple: List[bool]) -> int:
        hasApple[0], degree = True, [0] * n

        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].append(v)
            graph[v].append(u)
            degree[u] += 1
            degree[v] += 1
        queue = collections.deque(v for v in range(n) if degree[v] == 1)
        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()
            if hasApple[u]: continue
            for v in graph[u]:
                if degree[v] > 0:
                    degree[v] -= 1
                    degree[u] -= 1
                    if degree[v] == 1:
                        queue.append(v)
        return sum(degree)
        
# Approach 3:

        # Since the tree is undricted, we need to add both directions in the tree.

            # Since it is a tree, there will be no cycles.

            # case1, res != 0, this means we have found some apples down the tree
            # case2, hasApple[node]==True, this means the current node has a apple on it
            # In both cases, we will have to increase the result by 2.
            # Adding 2 because we need 1 to get to this node and 1 going back
            if res or hasApple[node]:
                return res + 2
            
            # There is no apple on this node or down the tree, res should 0.
            # In this case we don't want to come to this node at all, so return 0.
            return res
        
        # Following the dfs, you can see that when we coming back to node 0, if there are some apples in the tree,
        # We added an extra 2 to the result, so we need to -2 here.
        # In case there is no apples in this tree, dfs will return 0, but we can't return -2, so just return 0
        return max(dfs(0,-1)-2, 0)
