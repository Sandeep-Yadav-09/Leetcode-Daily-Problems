** 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        countB = 0
        deletions = 0

        for ch in s:
            if ch == 'b':
                countB += 1
            else:
                deletions = min(deletions + 1, countB)

        return deletions

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def minimumDeletions(self, s: str) -> int:
        stack = []
        count = 0

        for char in s:
            if stack and stack[-1] == 'b' and char == 'a':
                stack.pop()
                count += 1
            else:
                stack.append(char)

        return count
