** 191. Number of 1 Bits **

# Approach 1:
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int: 
        count = 0
        while n:
            count += 1
            n = n & (n - 1)
        
        return count

# Approach 2:
class Solution:
    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int: 
        return sum((n & (1<<i))!=0 for i in range(32))
